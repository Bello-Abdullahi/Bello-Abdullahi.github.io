abstract: "In this study we examined the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth in Nigeria. Utilizing the auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the existence of long-run relationship between the independent and dependent variables was found. Additionally, we conducted the granger causality test to determine the direction of causality. The ARDL bounds testing result shows that labor has a long-term negative impact on economic growth, with foreign direct investment, exchange rates, and capital having a positive influence. The pair-wise Granger-causality results showed the existence of a bidirectional relationship between FDI and economic growth. Based on our findings, we suggested that the Federal government should pursue a strategy to attract FDI by enhancing Nigeria's business climate, environment, and infrastructure and achieving stable exchange rate to increase investors' confidence. Additionally, we recommended the enhancement of educational policies in the country to improve the human capital and skilled workforce."
