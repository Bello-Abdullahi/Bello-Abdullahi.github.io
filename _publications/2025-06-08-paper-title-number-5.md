<p align="justify"> <b>Abstract.</b>  In Nigeria, inflation dynamics and food prices have been a major concern for policymakers and the public alike. In recent years, the country has experienced a surge in food prices, which has contributed to the rise in inflation. In this study we employed the linear autoregressive distributive lag model to investigate inflation dynamics and food prices in Nigeria, with a specific focus on identifying the fundamental factors driving the increase in food prices. Our findings reveal that higher oil prices exert a short-term large positive influence on food prices, but their long-term impact is negligible. Conversely, increased money supply significantly impacts food prices in both the short and long term.
